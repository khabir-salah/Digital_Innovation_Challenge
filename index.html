          <h2>Historical Significance: From Prosperity to Neglect</h2>
          <p>
            Calabar South, during the reign of Nigeria's first government,
            thrived as a hub for international trade. At the heart of this
            economic activity was the Calabar Port, which served as a key point
            for import and export. The waterfront was not only vital for
            generating revenue but also attracted foreign settlers, whose
            abandoned homes still stand today. This bustling trade center was a
            source of pride for the state.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the once-vibrant Calabar Port Market is now a shadow of
            its former self. Neglect has turned it into a marketplace for petty
            traders, overshadowing its potential as a significant economic
            asset. The river that runs through Calabar South, which could serve
            as both a transportation route and a tourist attraction, lies
            underutilized.

          <h2>Infrastructure Needs</h2>
          <p>
            The most pressing need is the rehabilitation of the Calabar Port
            Market and its surrounding infrastructure. The area has long lacked
            proper maintenance, and without urgent intervention, it risks
            further degradation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Roads leading to the market are in disrepair.</li>
            <li>
              Basic facilities like water supply, sanitation, and waste
              management are insufficient or non-existent.
            </li>
            <li>
              The old foreign residences, relics of the colonial era, remain
              abandoned and could be restored for modern use.
            </li>

          <h2>Opportunities</h2>
          <p>Despite the challenges, Calabar South is ripe with opportunity:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Employment:</strong> By redeveloping the market, hundreds
              of jobs could be created, ranging from construction to market
              management.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transportation:</strong> The river could serve as a
              transportation route, alleviating pressure on roads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Revenue Generation:</strong> Like Tin Can Island Port in
              Lagos, a revitalized Calabar Port could become a revenue hub.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cultural Tourism:</strong> Historical buildings could
              attract tourists, boosting the local economy.
            </li>
          </ul>
